```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

**Explanation:**

The original code `function sum(){ return a+b;}` had a couple of potential issues:

1. **Missing Parameters:** The function `sum()` was defined without any parameters (arguments).  It was trying to add `a` and `b`, but `a` and `b` were not passed to the function when it was called.  This would likely result in errors if `a` and `b` weren't defined elsewhere in the scope.

2. **Undefined Variables:** Even if `a` and `b` were defined outside the function, it's generally bad practice to rely on global variables inside a function.  It makes the function less predictable and harder to reuse.

**The corrected code addresses these issues:**

* **`function sum(a, b)`:** This defines the function `sum` and specifies that it accepts two parameters named `a` and `b`. These parameters act as local variables within the function's scope.

* **`return a + b;`:** This line adds the values of `a` and `b` together and returns the result.

**How to use it:**

```javascript
let result = sum(5, 3); // Call the function with arguments 5 and 3
console.log(result);     // Output: 8

let anotherResult = sum(10, -2); // Call the function with arguments 10 and -2
console.log(anotherResult);    // Output: 8
```

**Key Improvements:**

* **Clear Parameter Definition:**  The corrected code explicitly states that the function expects two inputs (`a` and `b`).
* **Scoped Variables:** The function operates on its own local variables (`a` and `b`), making it more self-contained and reliable.
* **Reusability:**  The function can be used to add any two numbers you pass to it.
